  content: In response to Anthony's requests, I brought supplies for the Swing Space cluster cabinet. I also brought a stapler and left a note saying that if it "disappeared," we wouldn't be able to get a replacement for the rest of the school year. Sadly, the stapler was gone in less than 3 days. I have little faith in humanity now.

    For students coming in needing Windows on their Macs (for a few different classes): the procedure we've been following is to install Virtual Box, get them an MSDN-AA Key for Windows 7 and then install Windows 7 on their virtual machine. In setting up the virtual machine, we've been giving it 1 gig of ram and a 20 gb virtual drive.
    
    There is a dmg file for Virtual Box on the USB key with the tag on it in the TTO.

  content: Etan came back today to ask about the missing USB cable. He needs to use it immediately and he will return it tomorrow, Sep 19th. Since his original kit was incomplete and no one will check out a panasonic HDC until 20th, I lent him a USB cable from the white Panasonic HDC kit. So whoever helps him check in the equipment should expect to get that USB cable back and put it back into the white kit.

See if you can figure it out. Thanks!

    A user came asking how to put Windows 7 on his laptop. We're going to make a flash drive of his bootable and work with that. I was using the tutorial here http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-7vista-from-usb-drive-detailed-100-working-guide/
    
    His flash drive wasn't quite large enough, so he's going home to get the sd card from his phone to use (he has an adapter)
    It should be a piece of cake. Good luck ;D

  content: The first time I kilroyed since we updated to Windows 7, I received a message that basically said "there are no available servers for you to log on to." The person using the computer next to me had the same problem, so she just left. After a reboot, I was able to log on (albeit following a long delay of waiting for Windows to load). Is anyone else in Pierson experiencing this problem, or is this just an isolated anomaly?

    There is *always* something to do in the io. Go through the closet ticket by ticket. Organize the closet and wrap up all of the adapters. Organize the storage closet. Clean the kitchen. Make a TTO run. Clean the work area. There are a bajillion options, pick one.

  content: Nnamdi - there's a computer here running Disk Cleanup because he only had like 2GB free space. If you could run a defragment after that, that'd be great. Also the fan is making strange noises but the computer doesn't crash or get particularly hot so I was thinking of just pulling off the cover and blowing some compressed air into it (the computer's way out of warranty so no worries on that front) to see if that helps. I didn't have a chance to file a ticket for this guy b/c it's been a crazy shift, but he's hanging out right outside the TTO and plans to drop in again as soon as you get here. I'd stick around to deal with it, but I have to go to class. Thanks!

    TO ALL DUNHAM ST's:
    
    Arther K. Watson Hall, also know as AKW, requires its printers filled every weekday. The first person to have a shift beginning after noon is supposed to do this. Adam mentioned this at the last meeting, and it still isn't getting done. If you're unsure what this means, there are instructions on the weke:

    So the Stakka can SOS in two ways:
    1. The main turn table gets stuck: just turn the table manually and power reset it
    2. The little arm that pushes the CDs out gets stuck: using a ruler or a pair of scissors, depress the little arm inside the main turn table and power reset it while pushing it down. Release the arm and extract the ruler or scissors as soon as you plug the Stakka back in or else you risk breaking some CDs.

    Please check to see whether someone already has a ticket open before creating new tickets. You can do this either by asking the student whether they've filed a help request online already, or ask them their college and look for their name in the appropriate queue.

    Hi! When you get here, try logging onto the print stations for cl_laser2, bass_laser4 (upstairs). If it logs on quickly and painlessly, trash this sticky.
    
    There seems to be problems with the print servers, so students might be unable to log onto the print stations connected to cl_laser2, bass_laser4. If that happens, tell them to try CT Hall/Dunham (cl_laser1 is down, too).

    Posting this because the last shipment of paper was just left out in the cluster for days.
    If paper arrives during your shift, or if your shift starts and you notice new paper in the cluster:
    1. Update your shift report accordingly.
    2. Move the boxes into the cabinet. This is not optional; it's the job. When you don't do this, paper gets stolen or put into the printers incorrectly.

    Consolidation of reminders:
    1. Don't overfill trays. This helps prevent jams.
    2. Open the cluster doors if it's between 8am and 5pm.
    3. Don't leave a printer on its page count screen; they don't print in that state.
    4. Tray 3 of laser1 was changed to "A4" so it would stop complaining about being out of A4. This may or may not cause problems in the future.

    Posting this again because the last shipment of paper was just left out in the cluster for days again despite AJ already posting this.
    If paper arrives during your shift, or if your shift starts and you notice new paper in the cluster:
    1. Update your shift report accordingly.
    2. Move the boxes into the cabinet. This is not optional; it's the job. When you don't do this, paper gets stolen or put into the printers incorrectly. 
    3. Resolve the relevant ticket on RT.

    If tray 1 is filled up to the top, i.e one exact ream of 500 paper it gives a false misfeed error in section A. If you reduce it by a bit though it works but makes strange noises it should not be making. If you reduce paper in the tray considerably it works fine.

    If whoever is working the BMT desk today could give Stephanie Douglass a call (8593128685) at the end of their shift if the RED tripod remains unclaimed, that'd be great.  She wants to make a reservation, and the tripod is with us physically, but the person who had a reservation on it for today hasn't shown up yet to pick it up.
    thanks!

    - wake up all computers and make sure they are functioning properly
    - ensure that no hardware is missing (mice, keyboards...) if anything is missing or broken, email cluster.support@yale.edu and explain the situation. They'll come in and fix it for us
    - get printer page count
    - refill the paper in the printer
    - troubleshoot any error messages: here's the ikon service request instruction page of the weke (http://weke.its.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Ikon_Service_Request#Ikon_service_request). The printer ID# is written in black on a sticker on the front side of the printer
    - refill the stapler with staples
    - make sure there is a spare toner. That means that if you replace the toner, it's your responsibility to drop off the old toner cartridge at the io and pick up a replacement for us.
    - update the status of es_laser3
    - update the states of ES Cabinet
    - chill and do homework : )

    Both TTO and Io: it seems there are a fair number of tickets that are marked as return to TTO that according to RT are still in the IO despite having been marked as return to TTO before the last run. Since one of them is my ticket, I'm just kinda curious if it's still in the io or if it got transferred and no one marked it. Could someone from the TTO and someone from the io check the following tickets:
    RT#27776
    RT#27192
    RT#27537
    RT#27766

    If the toner runs out on shift, and there is none in the TTO, you should go over to the IO, where there are always lots of spares.
    
    In any case, when you check the printers, you should check for spare toners in the TTO. If there are none, you can ask some to be collected on the next IO run, and this will save you a trip to the IO when toner does actually run out.

  content: |-
    Some students might be dropping off some equipment checked out from Robin Ladouceur at the Instructional Learning Group at Yale. Robin asked us to keep the equipment in the TTO until someone from ITG can get it from us.
    
    The equipment is as follows:
    Tablet - already dropped off and picked up by ITG
    Cyntiq Wacom Tablet
    Bamboo Wacom mouse extension
    
    Contact: Robin Ladouceur - 25159
    
    Please post a new sticky as each item of equipment is turned in by a student. BMTs - please direct students to the TTO if they are trying to return one of these pieces of equipment. Delete all stickies when ITG picks up all of the equipment from us.

    *Long story, but basically I bought a PS3 and a bunch of games and whatnot from Newegg, and just received word that the PS3 is out of stock. As such, Newegg decided to cancel the PS3 part of the order but still send/charge me for me all the games for my nonexistent PS3.  When I contacted them regarding this, they told me that to get a refund on everything, I need to reject the package. Since I'm having it sent here, I'd really appreciate it if you'd reject it on my behalf\xE2\x80\xA6.."

    Printer wisdom: 
    1) Don't slam the trays closed
    2) Make sure that the tray guides are securely around the paper and LOCKED into position; the margins will come out funny if they're left unlocked
    3) If a stack of paper has a slight bulge on one side, make sure to place the bulging side face down in the printer tray. This will help prevent paper jams when duplexing is used.
    4) Don't allow students to change the settings of the paper trays. If they need a different size, they should load their own paper into the bypass tray, and specify in their print settings to print to the bypass tray.
    5) Don't overfill the trays; they also contribute to jams.

    Hey Laura,
    I've got some things in the io that I'm fixing for a home friend, and if you're free I could use some help ;D
    There's a hard drive which I want to take out and get data from, but the enclosure is very difficult. After 20 minutes, I think I'd rather have someone with me before I break anything. I'm upstairs all day, so come say hi when you're free ;D

  content: The ST on shift in CT Hall should work with Explo. They'll have classes periodically throughout the day, both in CT Hall and Phelps (And you should visit ~hourly). You should introduce yourself to the counselor before they begin and offer your help; they'd really appreciate that. Also, if you do that then you probably won't have to interact with them again until another counselor comes in :)

    One more thing!
    I emailed cluster support about two issues: PHMC19 wasn't working still and the print station wanted an update.
    
    
    Next ST should check on PHMC12, I don't remember whether I got that one working. I didn't email cluster about that, but you may need to.

    If someone needs a PIN to reset their password:
    1) Verify their photo ID.  You must verify it or it cannot be reset.  So no resets over the phone.
    2) Call 6-5142.  If no one is available, get the student's contact phone number & send an email to studtech-st-mgr@mailman.yale.edu with the NetID, name, and phone number of the student who needs the reset.

    Ezra Stiles Swing Kilroy:
    - wake up all computers and make sure they are functioning properly
    - ensure that no hardware is missing (mice, keyboards...) if anything is missing or broken, email cluster.support@yale.edu and explain the situation. They'll come in and fix it for us
    - get printer page count
    - refill the paper in the printer
    - troubleshoot any printer error messages: here's the ikon service request instruction page of the weke (http://weke.its.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Ikon_Service_Request#Ikon_service_request). The printer ID# is written in black on a sticker on the front side of the printer
    - make sure there is a spare toner. That means that if you replace the toner, it's your responsibility to drop off the old toner cartridge at the io and pick up a replacement for us.
    - update the status of es_laser2
    - update the states of ES Cabinet

  content: Bass laser 4 is out of black toner and nearly out of both blue and magenta. There is one full blue toner here in the TTO, but a TTO ST needs to bring the empty magenta and canary(?) bottles (plus other empty toner bottles) that are currently in the TTO closet to the Io. If the Io doesn't have replacements, that ST needs to file a toner request ticket in the print queue.

    2nd floor cluster printer has two problems:
    (1) A black horizontal line appears across every page that is printed.
    (2) If tray 1 is filled up to the top, there is a mysterious "page feed" error. Temporarily solution: remove paper from tray 1 until the error goes away.
    
    I put up a sign on the printer warning people about the problems.

  content: A key to a Yale dorm was found on the floor near the desk with CHPC06 and CHPC05. If someone comes looking, ideally they would point to one of those when asked which computer they were working at, and would say they left the cluster sometime before about 4:20 PM. I put it on the right side of the second-to-top shelf in the cabinet.
